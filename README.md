### equal-paths-test
This function gives a recursive routine to determine
if all the paths from leaves to root in a tree are of
the same length. To run the tests required for this function,
please ensure you are in the hw4 directory.
To compile and test the first set of tests, please run:
` make equal-paths-test`
To run the first set of tests, please type:
` ./equal-paths-test`
To compile and test the second set of tests, please run:
` cd hw4_tests/equalpaths-test`
`make equalpaths_tests`
To run the second set of extensive tests, please type:
`./equalpaths_tests`

### bst-test
This bst file has my implementations of insertion, removal,
clearing, finding a specific node in the tree, finding the smallest
node in the tree, checking if the tree is balanced, the constructor 
and destructor of the tree, and other unfinished functions of the iterator class in the tree. To run the tests required for this function,
please ensure you are in the hw4 directory.
To compile and test the first set of tests, please run:
` make bst-test`
To run the first set of tests, please type:
` ./bst-test`
To compile and test the second set of tests, please run:
` cd hw4_tests/bst_tests`
`make bst_tests`
To run the second set of extensive tests, please type:
`./bst_tests`

### avl_tests
This AVL tree file has my implementation of the insertion and removal
of nodes within an AVL tree. I also wrote a rotateLeft and rotateRight
function to assist in the insertion and removal. To run the tests
required for this function, please ensure you are in the avl_tests directory
of the hw4_tests directory. To do so, please run:
` cd hw4/hw4_tests/avl_tests`
To compile and test the first set of tests, please run:
` make avl_tests`
To run the tests, please type:
` ./avl_tests`
